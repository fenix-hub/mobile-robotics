# Ackermann Robot Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a ROS 2 implementation for mobile robotics navigation using an Ackermann steering model. The project is designed to provide a complete solution for simulating, controlling, and navigating a vehicle with Ackermann steering geometry.

## Packages

The project consists of three main packages:

### 1. ackermann_robot_description

This package contains the robot's physical description and simulation components:
- URDF model of the Ackermann steering robot
- Configuration files for robot joints and sensors
- Simulation world definitions
- Launch files for spawning the robot in simulation

### 2. ackermann_robot_navigation

This package implements the navigation stack for the Ackermann robot:
- Map files for navigation
- Navigation parameters and configurations
- RViz configurations for visualization
- Launch files for running navigation algorithms
- Custom navigation nodes specific to Ackermann steering constraints

### 3. ackermann_control_bridge

This package serves as a bridge between high-level navigation commands and low-level robot control:
- Translates navigation stack outputs into Ackermann steering commands
- Handles control transformations for proper Ackermann steering
- Provides interfaces for manual and autonomous control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ROS 2 (Humble or newer recommended)
- Gazebo or other compatible simulator
- Navigation2 (Nav2) stack
- C++ and Python development tools

### Building the Workspace

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not done already)
git clone <repository-url> ~/ackermann_ws
cd ~/ackermann_ws

# Install dependencies
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

# Build the workspace
colcon build --symlink-install
```

### Running the Simulation

```bash
# Source the workspace
source ~/ackermann_ws/install/setup.bash

# Launch the robot in simulation
ros2 launch ackermann_robot_description robot_simulation.launch.py

# In a new terminal, launch the navigation stack
source ~/ackermann_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch ackermann_robot_navigation navigation.launch.py
```

## Development

### Adding New Maps

Place new map files in the `ackermann_robot_navigation/maps` directory and create corresponding launch files that reference them.

### Modifying Robot Parameters

Robot physical parameters can be adjusted in the URDF files located in `ackermann_robot_description/urdf`.

### Customizing Navigation Behavior

Navigation parameters can be modified in the parameter files located in `ackermann_robot_navigation/params`.
